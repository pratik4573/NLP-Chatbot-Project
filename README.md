# NLP Chatbot Project
# 🤖 NLP Chatbot using TF-IDF & Streamlit (End-to-End Project)

An **end-to-end NLP chatbot project** built using **TF-IDF vectorization and Machine Learning**, deployed as an **interactive web application using Streamlit**.
This project demonstrates the **complete ML lifecycle** — from text preprocessing and model training to deployment and user interaction.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Traditional chatbots often rely on rule-based systems that lack flexibility. This project aims to build a **data-driven NLP chatbot** that can understand user queries using text vectorization and respond intelligently.

---

## ✅ Solution Approach

* Preprocessed text data using NLP techniques
* Converted text into numerical form using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
* Trained a **machine learning classification model** to map user queries to responses
* Built a **Streamlit-based UI** for real-time interaction
* Deployed the application for public access
